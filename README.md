# LeetCode Exercises

Welcome to my  LeetCode Exercises repository! This is where I document my journey of sharpening my problem-solving skills by solving LeetCode challenges on a regular basis.

## File Naming Convention

Each exercise is stored in a separate file following the naming convention:

- `N | Y`: If I was able to solve the problem without any help.
- `<Subject>`: Descriptive name of the exercise name.
- `<Problem name>`: Name of the leetCode problem name.


## File Structure

Each file will contain the following sections:

1. **Problem Definition**: A description of the problem statement.

2. **Parameters**: List of input parameters required for the function.

3. **Returns**: Expected output or return value.

4. **Examples**: Examples illustrating the usage of the function.

5. **Pseudo Code**: High-level plan before the actual code implementation.

6. **Code**: Implementation of the solution.

Older files may not have this structure but newer ones will.
